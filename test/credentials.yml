# The following file is used to specify credentials for the remote tests.
# In the CI environment, the environment are populated with proper values.
# If the values are not set, the remote tests will be skipped.
#
# If you want to run remote tests locally, you can set these environment
# variables, or you can create a file `~/.reactive_shipping/credentials.yml`,
# and set the values in there. This way you won't accidentially commit them
# to git.
